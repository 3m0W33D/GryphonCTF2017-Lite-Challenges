# Done In A Diffie
Start python socket server.

## Question Text
Aw snap... Our key exchange client program has been corrupted. Luckily we have a backup plan. There is a manual key exchange server located at `nc play.spgame.site 20000`.

## Setup Guide
1. Modify port number
2. Start python socket server

## Solution
1. Perform Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange with server.
2. Hash the shared key with MD5 to produce a 16 byte hash (in bytes).
3. Decode the base64 encoded encrypted string into bytes.
4. Build the AES-128-ECB key with the shared key hash.
5. Perform decryption on the ciphertext to obtain the flag.

Flag: GCTF{7H3_6R4ND_3XCH4N63_4ND_7H3_6R347_D3CRYP7}
