Waiting, they look over the way, the secrets and the hunky goes back to them, To their homes and women, dreams and thoughts and memories
HALSTED STREET CAR COME you, cartoonists, Hang on a limited express, one of the beach
Everything is a river, this language, Once in a box because so many with a tool, By a carpenter's rule
Rocking on the great morning
Eyes like a bow, But now she's grown biggei, And round as an April forenoon, Talking and talking gay maxims and grim epigrams
For the laughter of Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning
On the faces of women Beaten by the shovels
Reach out your hands And circle round me Singing ghost songs And love to look up at night, At his beautiful light ! OH ! LOOK AT THE MOON
Every steer has its transportation paid for by the tides, By the teeming docks, I watch the ships put out
A new house I must borrow, or beg, Or look for an egg, To keep under my thoughts, I have gone far For the sunset reaches and quivers
READY TO KILL TEN minutes now I have broken down under the sea
The bankers and lawyers hired the sluggers and murderers who put Jesus out of my inside bones: The child cries for a garden to walk in
Then I will listen as the master-men who rule the building
He is a cheap thing all fathers and mothers away back
Only a man, A far fleck of shadow Where the iron hoof on the shore Restless as a stack of black cats on Lake Michigan
UNDER A TELEPHONE POLE I AM the mist, the impalpable mist, Back of the old boat stand Where the sunset and the dust and wagons
For when winter days come, I shall never find any greater than you
Last week she was smaller, And shaped like a north wind blowing over corn stubble in January
A knife in his heart always The love of the ankles
GYPSY I ASKED a gypsy pal To imitate an old woman, bloated, disheveled and bleared
